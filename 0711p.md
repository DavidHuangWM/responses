1\. Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations?

No, absolutely not. My social distance detector (from the provided code/files) was not able to even identify the people in the video correctly. While I understand that the program may have run better on a more horizontal, slanted-from-above angle, the program should have been able to identify people from a birds-eye view. I think one of the issues why it wasn't even able to identify the people was because of the darkness that came from the people's shadows, making their figure look a lot bigger to the machine. As a result, the social distance detector was not able to effectively detect potential violations for my pedestrians video.

2\. Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time? How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?

I don't think so, not for infections, at least. Infections would be hard to determine unless we let the program decide what an "infection" is based on 1 or 2 parameters at most, such as distance, making it easier (but still inaccurate). This is to say that a number of factors contribute to infections, which isn't just limited to distance. For example, wearing a face mask, or sneezing directly at someone, or even wearing a full hazmat suit with plastic glass over your face. If I were to implement such an approach, I would have the program at least be able to estimate new infections by distance, and then maybe detect if people's mouths are open to add a second. I think that the best way to approach and then implement this would be to first obtain more research from scientists and doctors, telling us what directly correlates to the spread of COVID-19 in the midst of this pandemic, then coming up with a better detection system from there.

3\. What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?

As already stated in the previous question, to hopefully add more dimensions to the detector, such as detecting when mouths are open and whatnot. (This would be hard, unless... we had a camera to see people from the street from all 360 degrees.) I would also wait for more information from professionals, and implement those to be able to better estimate new infections; something that has a better correlation, such as masks and whatnot, or even sneezing/talking.
