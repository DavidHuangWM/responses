This project gave me a lot of troubles, especially with the longer wait times (which, I'm sure is because of the much larger file and import sizes to work with in the models). I had the most trouble importing the files and working with my system/compiler, and trying to get my code to run properly by adjusting the details of the model.

I started off by testing a small toy model of 10, with 9 training and 1 testing. The observations were all over the place in terms of accuracy, but this was just to test to make sure it didn't give me an error when running.

In my model, I decided to use a Conv2D layer followed by a MaxPooling2D layer, 3 times. Then, 2 dense layers, where the latter dense layer would be 1 single node. This would be able to best determine the final population, as the expected output is the estimation of the population! All of the activations had to be relu, since none of the data or outputs are really a category or binary (classifications). I also used the RMSprop optimizer with the learning rate of 0.001, and mse as the loss function. I think that the adam optimizier may have worked as well, but ultimately decided to use RMSprop for at least the first run of my project (which ended up being my last, due to how much time the entire project took). Whether or not the adam optimizer improves the performance is unknown--I may want to try doing so if I were to repeat this project. I used mse and mae for my metrics, as these would be able to tell me how far off the predictions were. I used 10 epochs for all runs, feeling that 10 would be a good fit for this project. Going higher would make the model extremely overfit, which was unnecessary. I also didn't want to let my project run for too many epochs, as it could easily take too much time to run for such a large dataset. As for the training and testing data, I decided to split it so that the Accra4.zip file would be the 1000 data points (10% of the total) for testing, and rest for training (90% of the total, so 9000 data points).

The final model was decent, but I wouldn't consider it "good." It seemed to be able to pick up on structures and identify higher populations within manmade structures (such as houses and even roads) instead of other places, such as large patches of greenery (such as trees or forests, and large patches of land or plains/fields).
