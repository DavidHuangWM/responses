1\. Go to Neural style transfer and complete the tensorflow exercise at that location. Read the linked paper about the method by Gatys et al. Modify the content_image and style_image to produce your own stylize work of art. Minimize the number of epoch runs in order to output your produced image faster for review and consideration. Incorporate the total variation loss method in your script and increase the number of epochs to improve the quality of your stylized artwork. Use your stylized artwork to draft an entry for the Jump Start Data Science Summer Program competition. Use your imagination when designing your proposed teeshirt. Feel free to design either a square shaped space for the front, front and back or a whole of tee-shirt approach. Be sure to identify the Jump Start Data Science Summer Program in your draft entry. Create a GitHub pages site, upload your design, and provide a brief description of the inspiration you drew upon in order to create your work of art!

# Jump Start Data Science Summer Program Tee-Shirt Design Competition

Using some banner-like designs with an initially modern and crisp look, I decided to draw inspiration from that. I love how I was able to create a watery but interpretable look for data science--even the words in the background are readable! It also creates a really nice shade/radiance around the words, too, fitting perfectly on a tee-shirt and probably blending in with the cloth's base color, whilst sporting the nice "DATA SCIENCE" title out front.

I think that this image could also work; it's a lot more colorful. I drew inspiration from making my own pattern in Microsoft Paint, and then applying a colorful, explosive-neon pattern style onto it, with numbers in the background. Either of these images would work.
