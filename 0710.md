# My Summary of Tommy Jones' speaking session 

Tommy Jones spoke about his experiences in the programming and science world. He mentioned that he participated in the Marines and worked for them, too. Now he's busy in meetings and with other people, but he gets to work on a lot of his research (that he also worked on in school) in the afternoons when he gets a break. He did talk about how he works at his company in-Q-Tel, now. 

Some of the tips that he gave included how computer science and statistics are literally "eating away" at the entire world right now, where those two are the biggest and most useful knowledges/qualities to have in ANY field. The ability to compute and manipulate a program to do automate work for you is very useful. 

He also did say that humans make things for themselves; we're narcissistic. I thought this was interesting. He said that people keep fearing that humans will be replaced by machinery, but he refuted that by saying that since humans are so into themselves, we actually make machines FOR us, not to replace us. Humans will always be valuable and have to be there to learn about the things, such as managing these data and calculations that we're doing today in our data science classes.
