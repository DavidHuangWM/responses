A. Premade estimators

1\. How did you split the labels from the training set? What was the name of the labels dataset?

The labels were split from the training set using the pop() function. The name of the labels dataset is train_y, which pops from species, being 'Setosa', 'Versicolor', and 'Virginica'. test_y also contained the labels dataset.

2\. List 5 different estimators from tf.estimator and include the base command as you would write it in a script (for example this script used the tf.estimator.DNNClassifier() function from the API).

DNNEstimator, LinearEstimator, LinearRegressor, BoostedTreesEstimator, DNNLinearCombinedClassifier.

```python
classifier = tf.estimator.DNNEstimator()
classifier = tf.estimator.LinearEstimator()
classifier = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor()
classifier = tf.estimator.BoostedTreesEstimator()
classifier = tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedClassifier()
```

3\. What are the purposes input functions and defining feature columns?

The purpose of input functions supply data for training, evaluating, and prediction. The purpose of defining feature columns is to determine or "tell" the model how it should use the raw input data from the features dictionary.

4\. Describe the command classifier.train() in detail. What is the classifier and how did you define it? Which nested function (and how have you defined it) are you applying to the training and test detests?

The command classifier.train() is what trains the classifier to the data. In this case, the classifier is and is defined as DNNClassifier from tf.estimator as a premade estimator, with its respective attributes (feature_columns, hidden_units, and n_classes) set. train() is defined with (input_fn=lambda: input_fn(train, train_y, training=True), steps=5000).

5\. Redefine your classifier using the DNNLinearCombinedClassifier() as well as the LinearClassifier(). Retrain your model and compare the results using the three different estimators you instantiated. Rank the three estimators in terms of their performance.

LinearClassifier was the best estimator with an accuracy of 0.967, then DNNLinearCombinedClassifier with an accuracy of 0.867, and lastly DNNClassifier with an accuracy of 0.767.

B. Build a Linear Model

1\. Using the dftrain dataset, upload an image where you used the seaborn library to produce a sns.pairplot(). Also include a histogram of age using the training set and compare it to the seaborn plot for that same feature (variable). What interpretation can you provide of the data based on this plot?

![image026](https://github.com/dshuangg/responses/raw/master/image026.png)

The histogram matches the corner plot (uppermost, leftmost corner) in similarity. This is where age is plotted against age, and is instead replaced with the univariate plot. We can tell from these plots that most passengers were between 20 and 30 years old.

2\. What is the difference between a categorial column and a dense feature?

3\. Describe the feature columns that have been input to your LinearClassifier(). How would you assess the result from your initial output? What is the purpose of adding a cross featured column? Did your attempt to capture the interaction between age and gender and incorporate it into your model improve performance? Include and interpret your predicted probabilities and ROC curve plots.
