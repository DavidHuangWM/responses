(1) In Laurence Maroneyâ€™s video, What is ML, he compares traditional programming with machine learning and argues that the main difference between the two is a reorientation of the rules, data and answers. According to Maroney, what is the difference between traditional programming and machine learning? 

In traditional programming, the programmer determines the function (which are the rules, the things that happen) and what manipulates the data that's passed in. On the other hand, machine learning is where we let the computer figure out the rules by passing in the input and the expected answers (which is considered "labeling"), where the computer figures out the function (the rules). 

Simplified, it's that traditional programming is rules + data --> answers, vs machine learning is answers + data --> rules. 

(2) With the first basic script that Maroney used to predict a value output from the model he estimated (he initially started with 10 that predicted ~31). Modify the predict function to produce the output for the value 7. Do this twice and provide both answers. Are they the same? Are they different? Why is this so? 

No, because the model takes steps towards the right answer in different sizes. The epochs (number of loops/iterations) is also limited to 500 so it will not always be the same as it doesn't always run until 100% completion, but will get pretty close. 

(3) Using the script you produced to predict housing price, take the provided six houses and train a neural net model that estimates the relationship between them. Based on this model, which of the six homes present a good deal? Which one is the worst deal? Justify your answer. 

Hudgins (3 bd 97k), Mathews (5 bd 347.5k), Mobjack (4 bd 289k), and Newptcomfort (3 bd 229k) are homes that present a good deal. The worst deal is Moon (2 bd 250k). This is because I printed the predicted prices for houses that are between 1-10, allowing the program to guess what the prices should be, as it was fit to the input data. The 4 houses that I listed as "good deals" are considered good deals because they each fall under the fit price (that the program guessed for the house). On the other hand, the worst deal is Moon (2 bd 250k) because the predicted price is two-thirds of the actual price, so the actual price would be "way too high" and thus "not a good deal"!
