A. In the video, First steps in computer vision, Laurence Maroney introduces us to the Fashion MNIST data set and using it to train a neural network in order to teach a computer “how to see.” One of the first steps towards this goal is splitting the data into two groups, a set of training images and training labels and then also a set of test images and test labels. Why is this done? What is the purpose of splitting the data into a training set and a test set?

As Maroney explains, "if you show them all the shoes, then there's no point. You'd have to show them some shoes, then let them train by identifying and picking out new things that they've never seen before." The purpose of training and testing data is to provide data (with their respective labels!) to train the model on, then have the model assess its accuracy overall using its testing score.

B. The fashion MNIST example has increased the number of layers in our neural network from 1 in the past example, now to 3. The last two are .Dense layers that have activation arguments using the relu and softmax functions. What is the purpose of each of these functions. Also, why are there 10 neurons in the third and last layer in the neural network.

Having more layers lets the neural network to identify more pieces and assign coefficients of importance from each neuron to the next, how much one neuron's importance is in determining each of the values of the next. The two activation arguments using relu and softmax are used to help more easily and quickly process the data in the program. "relu" is used to set all negative values to 0 (and leaves positive values where they are), and "softmax" sets the highest value (the strongest value in correlation to the aspect being tested) to 1.0, and the others to 0. There are 10 in the last layer because there are 10 items total to be identified, assigning the object with the highest possibility as the one that the program will assign the label for the passed object to be.

C. In the past example we used the optimizer and loss function, while in this one we are using the function adam in the optimizer argument and sparse_categoricalcrossentropy for the loss argument. How do the optimizer and loss functions operate to produce model parameters (estimates) within the model.compile() function?

The optimizer and loss functions are the program's primary way of evaluating and bettering the model by making guesses. The optimizer is the way that it's making guesses and deciding the steps in the right direction by shaping the model, whereas the loss determines how "bad" or "off" the model is.

D. Using the mnist drawings dataset (the dataset with the hand written numbers with corresponding labels) answer the following questions. 
  \1. What is the shape of the images training set (how many and the dimension of each)? 
  
The shape of the images training set (note: this is of the entire set, not of each of the individual images themselves) is 60000 * 28 * 28. 
  
  \2. What is the length of the labels training set? 
  
The length of the labels training set is 60000. 
  
  \3. What is the shape of the images test set? 
  
The shape of the images test set is 10000 * 28 * 28. 
  
  \4. Estimate a probability model and apply it to the test set in order to produce the array of probabilities that a randomly selected image is each of the possible numeric outcomes (look towards the end of the basic image classification exercises for how to do this — you can apply the same method applied to the Fashion MNIST dataset but now apply it to the hand written letters MNIST dataset). 
  
Completed. Probability model estimated, and applied to the test set. Nothing to return. 
  
  \5. Use np.argmax() with your predictions object to return the numeral with the highest probability from the test labels dataset. 
  
Numeral returned with the highest probability: 

  \6. Produce the following plot for your randomly selected image from the test dataset
