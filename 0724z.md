# My Summary of Ben Arancibia and Jasper Liu's Lunch & Learn Session

Ben Arancibia talked about his past, following through his education and his background. He now works as a data scientist at GSK. He believes that while the old idea was that there are two separate kinds of people on a team--being the math people who construct experiments and create the ideas, and then the programmers that implement those ideas--those don't actually need to be separated. We don't need to separate those nowadays. He talks about how some people in the biostat field actually do both, and how we're able to do quick analysis of the market and we don't need statisticians to plan and do those things. He then talks about the process of the working field for data science, such as interviews, etc. Something interesting that I heard was that employers look for certain, specific things during interviews. They try and see how you work as a person and your ability to problem solve. This even involves looking things up on Google! Some interviews even use whiteboards to facilitate this. Being able to speak well is also a plus in the data science field. His tips are to get a job, build connections early. It doesn't even need to be in the field that you're aiming at. Be smart and take things to a personal level about reaching out, too.
