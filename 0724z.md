# My Summary of Ben Arancibia and Jasper Liu's Lunch & Learn Session

Ben Arancibia talked about his past, following through his education and his background. He now works as a data scientist at GSK. He believes that while the old idea was that there are two separate kinds of people on a team--being the math people who construct experiments and create the ideas, and then the programmers that implement those ideas--those don't actually need to be separated. We don't need to separate those nowadays. He talks about how some people in the biostat field actually do both, and how we're able to do quick analysis of the market and we don't need statisticians to plan and do those things. He then talks about the process of the working field for data science, such as interviews, etc. Something interesting that I heard was that employers look for certain, specific things during interviews. They try and see how you work as a person and your ability to problem solve. This even involves looking things up on Google! Some interviews even use whiteboards to facilitate this. Being able to speak well is also a plus in the data science field. His tips are to get a job, build connections early. It doesn't even need to be in the field that you're aiming at. Be smart and take things to a personal level about reaching out, too.

Jasper Liu also talked about his past, following through his education and his background/upbringing. Some of his workplaces are highly regulated and things are slow. He wanted to work in a place that was fast(er)-paced! Unfortunately, he was laid off due to COVID. He goes on talking about other things about his jobs and the current field (going on right now, especially with COVID), such as airline rules. He does mention that employers are getting selective, but data science is something that's applicable to every single job. He recommends solving puzzles and competitions like Kaggle, which not only help you on paper but also with your actual problem solving skills. You need those critical thinking and problem solving skills, but also people look at you to see if you fit on a team. He also does mention that grad school doesn't necessarily make a difference, but sure, it looks good on a resume. Employers will take more experience over a person that has a higher degree! He also said that your first job is important to get, as it leads to other jobs. The first job doesn't have to be amazing.
