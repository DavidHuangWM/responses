A. Write a Problem Statement. Introduce your topic, quantify its significance, and describe the problem as a process. Identify and quantify significant obstacles to solving your problem. Demonstrate why your topic is important, and why the obstacles associated with your topic are significant both globally as well as within the context of your selected application. Describe and analyze the complex nature of the process you are investigating, including the system, the environment, agents and networks. Describe and analyze scope, scale and hierarchy of processes and sub-processes. Describe and analyze factors that contribute to quantified obstacles. Describe and analyze process oriented causes-effect relationships.

Right now, every country has their own data for how many people have confirmed cases of COVID-19. As time goes on, this number will inevitably (through logic), level off at some point. This model will be able to work with more accurate data as time goes on, but is there a way we can be able to determine the *percentage of persons affected with COVID-19 within a country* based on that country's geographical location (relative to the equator), (average) elevation, size (land), and position (distance to major bodies of water, such as oceans)? By doing so, we may be able to find out more about the disease and how it spreads (such as the disease being attracted to humid places near bodies of water, thus affecting countries like Mexico more than "landlocked" countries like Switzerland and Hungary). There will be outside factors that contribute, such as the country's regulations for masks for prevention, and other differences such as culture or access to medical preventative services. 

Another idea that I'd like to mention here is perhaps depression rates in the U.S., such as how age, race, weight, and sex/gender (or even sexual orientation) may affect how likely one is to experience or have depression in the U.S. as a percent possibility.

B. Up next for your final project: data (then after that: methods)

Data to be used will be the current confirmed cases (that are available) divided by the current population of each country to be the percentage of people with COVID-19 per country (by population). Then, we will use country data such as country land size, average elevation, etc. to find any correlation to countries with more or less percentage of people with COVID-19. This data would be easily found posted online, and would make it a lot more portable if the data were from the same dataset or producer (as having consistent naming conventions for countries would provide easier and more accurate labels).

C. Go to the website http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/ and review some of the posters for the University of Stanford’s Fall 2017 machine learning course. Consider how you will design and present your final project as a poster.

I think that having a tri-fold pamphlet may be best. This way, it can very nicely contain the information that I want to present in a neat format. On the left side, I may have the overview and the features, in the middle I may have some graphs and some results, and on the right I may explain some future notes or discussions and maybe even how my model can be improved. There could also be pictures on either of the 3 folds! (This pamphlet will be 1-sided--it won't be a real pamphlet. I'm just using the word "pamphlet" to describe how I want to split up or divide the paper.) Certain details will be explained using words in a paragraph-like style, but kept concise for the presentation to not be as thick as a report may be.

D. Describe your implementation of the cats & dogs exercise. How did you setup the data?

1\. Which optimizer have you selected, and how might it compare to other possible choices? (have a look at this site - https://towardsdatascience.com/understandingrmsprop-faster-neural-network-learning-62e116fcf29a)

hi

2\. Describe your selected loss function and it’s implementation. How is it effectively penalizing bad predictions? (have a look at this site - https:// towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visualexplanation-a3ac6025181a)

hi

3\. What is the purpose of the metric= argument in your model.compile() function? (look here - https://keras.io/api/metrics/)

hi

4\. Plot the accuracy and loss results for both the training and test datasets. Include these in your response. Assess the model and describe how good you think it performed.

hi

5\. Use the model to predict 3 dog images and 3 cat images. Upload you images and the prediction. How did your model perform in practice? Do you have any ideas of how to improve the model’s performance?

hi
